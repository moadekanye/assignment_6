In this project, I analyzed two datasets: one on loans and the well-known Fisher’s Iris dataset. For the loan data, I explored things like loan amounts, interest rates, and default rates to see how they change based on loan purpose, credit grade, and home ownership. I used one part of the code to clean up the data and another to make charts that highlight interesting patterns. For the Iris data, I made visuals to show how different species vary in petal and sepal sizes, which helps with classifying them. This project is just a basic look into the data—it doesn’t make predictions, and I filled in missing loan data with median values, which might affect accuracy.
